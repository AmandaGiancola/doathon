# Doathon Site Code

Here we keep the code that generates http://doathon.opencon2017.org/ on Github Pages. If you'd like to help us improve the site, or fix a bug, please go to [this repository](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon-dev). There we discuss and test any changes to the site before putting them here.
